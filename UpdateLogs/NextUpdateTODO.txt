Done:
- Charging a dash now move the entity back a little
- Movement now comes in movement behaviors
- Added other behaviors to dodge bullets, charge at player, etc.
- Now the only enemies used are Melee and Ranged Enemies
- Add A* path finding
- fix bug where spam clicking removes the movement debuff when shooting
- Add pits (can't move over them but can shoot over them)
- Add more enemy types
- Make ranged enemies move towards a closer range while shooting at reduced speed. This will also make them follow when the player moves.

TODO:
- Shadow renderers toevoegen aan alle enemies
- Ranged enemies movement behavior testen + parameters doen bij alle enemies.
- Add more decorative tiles
- Hit visual when enemies are hit
- Shooting animation
- Update pvp screen so player can choose the number of rounds
- Create multiple pvp arenas that the players can either choose or just randomly

Either:
- keep old campaign and leaderboard and create a new campaign and leaderboard so the player can choose what to play
- delete old campaign and leaderboard and replace with new one.
- Create new leaderboards for all time, weekly, daily

DO NEXT UPDATE
- Add new levels
- Add interactive objects (exploding barrels maybe)
